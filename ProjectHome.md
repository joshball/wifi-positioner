17 March 2013 - I recently had an idea about how to improve the software in order to became more useful. I will write all the upcomming new things down here.

# Description #

Today you can find everywhere a couple of access points. Just with their existence and their beacon signals, you can try to find your position within a map that you have generated and maybe saved in XML format.

# Current Version / Features #

Version 2.0 (in progress):
  * centralized reporting system for multiple WiFi devices
  * optional centralized calculation in order to reduce energy consumptions of clients
  * WBGTH (would be great to have) - porting to Linux in order to make it usable on Raspberry PI

Version 1.0:
  * creating virtual maps containing sectors and access points
  * saving maps in XML format
  * loading XML maps
  * manipulating map creation process by redefining parameters
  * mainpulating positiong finding proces by redefining parameters
